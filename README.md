**NEED TO RE-THINK**

## ~~Routes to-do~~

- ~~`/authorize` - Authentication pop-up: accepts whitelisted callbacks url~~

- ~~`/callback` - Callback: Redirected from discord oauth, redirect to last callback with switchblade token~~

- ~~`/api/@me` - Authorization check: Checks if the authorization is correct and returns auth status (id, access token, etc)~~

## ~~Other to-do's~~

- ~~HTTPS only (cloudflare can redirect HTTP to HTTPS)~~
